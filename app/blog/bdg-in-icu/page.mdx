# Interpreting β-D-glucan in ICU patients

β-D-glucan (BDG) is a sensitive but nonspecific marker of invasive fungal
disease. In critically ill patients, false positives are common and must be
interpreted in clinical context.

## Key points
- BDG alone is **not diagnostic** of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia
- ICU-related exposures (CRRT, IVIG, gauze) frequently cause false positives
- Fungal load and clinical syndrome matter more than a single value

## Clinical pearl
A positive BDG without compatible imaging or host risk factors should prompt
caution—not empiric antifungals by default.
