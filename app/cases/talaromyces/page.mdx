    A 36-year-old man presents with four weeks of fever, progressive weight loss,
    fatigue, and multiple painless skin lesions. He recently returned to the United

    chronic cough, intermittent diarrhea, and profound weakness.

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    He was diagnosed with HIV infection six months earlier but has not yet started
    antiretroviral therapy. He denies recent travel outside Southeast Asia and has
    no known tuberculosis contacts. He recalls frequent exposure to soil during the
    rainy season while working in rural areas.

    On examination, he appears cachectic and febrile. Numerous umbilicated papules
    and nodules are scattered across the face, trunk, and upper extremities,
    resembling molluscum contagiosum. Generalized lymphadenopathy and mild
    hepatosplenomegaly are present. Laboratory studies reveal anemia, leukocytosis,
    and a CD4 count of 38 cells/μL.

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    <em>Talaromyces marneffei</em> (formerly <em>Penicillium marneffei</em>) is a
    thermally dimorphic fungus endemic to Southeast Asia and southern China. It is
    an intracellular pathogen that primarily affects individuals with advanced HIV
    infection, although cases have also been described in patients with STAT1 gain-of-function
    mutations or autoantibodies to interferon-γ.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Infection is thought to occur via inhalation of environmental conidia, possibly
    from soil. Although the organism has been isolated from bamboo rats and their
    burrows, soil exposure appears to be a stronger epidemiologic risk factor.
    Disease incidence peaks during the rainy season.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Clinically, talaromycosis resembles disseminated histoplasmosis, with fever,
    weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and fungemia. Skin
    lesions occur in 60–70% of patients and frequently become umbilicated in those
    with HIV, mimicking molluscum contagiosum.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    On histopathology, yeast forms (2–6 μm) may be seen within macrophages or
    extracellularly. The hallmark finding is a transverse septum within the yeast,
    reflecting division by binary fission rather than budding. Culture at 30°C
    produces a mold that exudes a characteristic red pigment; conversion to yeast
    occurs at 37°C.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Untreated disseminated disease carries high mortality. The recommended therapy
    is intravenous amphotericin B for 2 weeks followed by oral itraconazole for
    10 weeks. Fluconazole is associated with high failure rates. Secondary
    prophylaxis with itraconazole is recommended in advanced HIV until immune
    reconstitution (CD4 ≥100 cells/μL for at least 6 months).

      Umbilicated skin lesions in advanced HIV from Southeast Asia should prompt
      consideration of talaromycosis.
