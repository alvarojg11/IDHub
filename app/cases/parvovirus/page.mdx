    A 62-year-old man with nonischemic cardiomyopathy undergoes orthotopic heart
    transplantation. Induction immunosuppression included rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG),
    followed by maintenance therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and low-dose
    prednisone.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    He is discharged on valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis and trimethoprim–
    sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. His early post-transplant course is
    uncomplicated, and surveillance biopsy shows no rejection.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Five weeks after transplantation, he presents with fatigue and low-grade fever. Laboratory
    testing reveals hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL (down from 10.8 g/dL at discharge), leukocyte count
    of 1.9 × 10⁹/L, and normal platelet count. Reticulocyte count is markedly reduced. Iron
    studies are normal.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Blood cultures, urine cultures, respiratory viral panel, CMV PCR, EBV PCR, and BK virus
    testing are negative. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows no occult
    infection or lymphoproliferative disease.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Mycophenolate and valganciclovir are held due to leukopenia. He receives packed red blood cell
    transfusion and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Despite these measures, anemia and
    leukopenia persist, and he is readmitted two weeks later with recurrent fatigue.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Rationale</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus with selective tropism for erythroid progenitor
    cells. In solid organ transplant recipients, impaired humoral immunity allows persistent viral
    replication, leading to pure red cell aplasia.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    The hallmark laboratory pattern is severe normocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia. Leukopenia
    may occur, particularly in the setting of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, which can
    obscure the diagnosis.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Diagnosis may be delayed because cytopenias are common after transplantation and often
    attributed to medications such as valganciclovir or mycophenolate. Persistent anemia despite
    transfusion or erythropoietin therapy should prompt testing for parvovirus B19 by PCR.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Infection may be community-acquired, transfusion-related, or potentially donor-derived.
    Lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy (e.g., antithymocyte globulin) is associated with
    increased risk.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Teaching Points</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
    <li>
      Parvovirus B19 should be considered in transplant recipients with refractory normocytic anemia
      and reticulocytopenia.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cytopenias are often attributed to medications; persistent or severe anemia warrants viral PCR
      testing.
    </li>
    <li>Bone marrow findings of giant pronormoblasts are classic.</li>
    <li>IVIG is first-line therapy and may require repeat dosing.</li>
    <li>Relapse can occur if immunosuppression remains intense.</li>
