    An 81-year-old man from Mississippi with alcohol use disorder, hypertension,
    and benign prostatic hyperplasia presents with fever and malaise.
    He reports mild urinary urgency and generalized malaise for the past 10 days.
    He denies focal pain, cough, abdominal symptoms, or neurologic complaints.

    Three months ago, he traveled to Arizona, staying near a farm.He lives with a dog 
    and recently adopted two kittens from a local pet store and has had multiple skin 
    excoriations. He also underwent a molar extraction 1 month ago. He denies any known 
    allergies to antibiotics.

    Physical examination is notable for temperature of 38.9°C, heart rate 118 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 bpm. 
    On auscultation there is a II/VI systolic murmur in cardiac apex radiating to the axilla
    Labs are notable for leukocytosis (15.4 × 10⁹/L) and elevated CRP (138 mg/L). Blood cultures are reported to be growing an organism
    (Gram stain is shown below). On culture, the organism is catalase negative and produces alpha-hemolytic colonies on blood agar.

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Aerococcus urinae is a Gram-positive, catalase-negative coccus that was first
    described in the 1990s as a causative organism of urinary tract infections (1).
    Although the organism is considered to be of low pathogenicity and may not always need to
    be treated, there are descriptions of severe, sometimes fatal infections,
    such as endocarditis, often in the presence of urinary tract infections or
    symptoms typical of this infection. 
  </p>
    
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Isolates of A. urinae may easily be mistaken for
    staphylococci on Gram stain, because they appear as Gram-positive cocci
    arranged in tetrads or clusters. Colonies on blood agar may be mistaken for
    streptococci, because these show alpha hemolysis and are catalase negative,
    resembling viridans streptococci and some enterococci. Primary identification
    is based upon Gram stain of alpha-hemolytic colonies that are catalase
    negative. Aerococcus species appear as Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which
    differentiates them from streptococci and enterococci. 
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">  
    Differentiation between A. urinae and Aerococcus viridans can be done by testing for pyrrolidinyl
    aminopeptidase (PYR), which is positive only for A. viridans, and leucine
    aminopeptidase (LAP), which is positive only for A. urinae. Automated systems
    such as Vitek are reliable for phenotypic identification, and 16S rRNA PCR may
    be used for genotypic confirmation. In some cases, blood cultures remain
    negative, in which case 16S rRNA PCR performed directly on blood culture may
    reveal A. urinae (PMID: 20660216).
