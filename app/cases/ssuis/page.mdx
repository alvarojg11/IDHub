    A 49-year-old woman who works on a small pig farm presents with abrupt onset of fever, myalgias,
    and headache followed by vomiting and watery diarrhea. Two days earlier, she helped butcher a sick pig
    and reports several small cuts on her hands from a kitchen knife. She did not wear gloves.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    On arrival to the emergency department she is ill-appearing with a temperature of 39.8°C,
    heart rate 126 beats/min, blood pressure 82/44 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 26 breaths/min.
    She has a diffuse erythematous blanching rash over the distal extremities with scattered petechiae.
    She is intermittently confused.

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Laboratory testing shows leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, acute kidney injury, elevated
    transaminases, and coagulopathy consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
    Lactate is elevated. Chest imaging demonstrates bilateral opacities concerning for evolving ARDS.

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    She is admitted to the ICU, started on vasopressors, and broad-spectrum antimicrobials are initiated.
    Blood cultures are growing gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains.

        "Incorrect. Leptospirosis can cause fever, AKI, and hepatitis, but it would not produce gram-positive cocci in pairs and short chains on blood culture, and the rash/petechiae with fulminant shock after pig butchering is more consistent with invasive streptococcal disease.",

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Rationale</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    <em>Streptococcus suis</em> is an important pathogen in pigs and a zoonotic cause of invasive infection
    in humans, classically acquired through skin breaks during handling of pigs or raw pork. Human disease
    often presents as meningitis or sepsis, but highly virulent strains—especially serotype 2—have been
    associated with outbreaks featuring a streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)-like phenotype with rapid
    progression to hypotension, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan failure.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    This case is deliberately tricky because early microbiology is nonspecific: gram-positive cocci in pairs
    and short chains can fit several streptococci, including group A streptococcus. The distinguishing feature
    is the epidemiology—direct exposure to a sick pig with unprotected skin cuts—strongly pointing to zoonotic
    <em> S. suis</em>. The combination of fulminant shock, erythematous rash with petechiae, DIC, and ARDS is
    consistent with an STSS-like syndrome.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Management is time-critical: aggressive supportive care (fluids/vasopressors and organ support) plus early
    effective antimicrobials. Definitive therapy for <em>S. suis</em> is typically a beta-lactam (e.g., high-dose
    IV penicillin G or ceftriaxone) guided by susceptibilities. Many clinicians add clindamycin early when a
    toxin-mediated streptococcal syndrome is suspected to inhibit toxin production, although the strongest
    evidence is for GAS rather than <em>S. suis</em>.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Teaching Points</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <em>Streptococcus suis</em> is a pig-associated zoonosis; human infection often follows exposure to pigs
      or raw pork via small skin breaks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Virulent serotype 2 strains can present with an STSS-like syndrome: high fever, hypotension/shock,
      rash/petechiae, DIC, ARDS, and multiorgan failure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Early blood culture morphology (gram-positive cocci in pairs/short chains) is not specific—epidemiology
      can be the decisive clue.
    </li>
    <li>
      Management requires immediate resuscitation and early antibiotics; definitive therapy typically uses
      a beta-lactam (e.g., penicillin G or ceftriaxone) based on susceptibilities. Consider adjunctive clindamycin
      when toxin-mediated streptococcal disease is suspected.
    </li>
