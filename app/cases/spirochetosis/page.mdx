    A 36-year-old man with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and psoriasis presents with
    intermittent constipation alternating with diarrhea and rectal bleeding for 10 days.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Two months prior to presentation, he was treated with a 14-day course of
    amoxicillin–clavulanate for presumed bacterial sinusitis. He denies sick contacts,
    consumption of undercooked food, or known inflammatory bowel disease.
  </p>  

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    He was born in Guatemala and currently lives in the United States. He reports recent travel
    to Puerto Rico within the past three months. He is sexually active with both men and women
    and takes daily HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis with tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC).
    He has no history of HIV infection.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    On presentation, he is afebrile with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute and a blood pressure
    of 124/67 mm Hg. Rectal examination does not reveal gross blood. Stool testing for common
    bacterial pathogens, <em>Clostridioides difficile</em> toxin/antigen, and fecal inflammatory
    markers is unrevealing. HIV testing is negative.

    Because symptoms persist, a colonoscopy is performed. The colonic mucosa appears grossly
    normal throughout. Random biopsies are obtained to evaluate for microscopic colitis.
    Histopathology reveals a basophilic “blue fringe” along the surface epithelium on hematoxylin
    and eosin staining, and a Warthin–Starry silver stain highlights spirochetes lining the
    colonic surface.

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Intestinal spirochetosis is defined by colonization of the colonic epithelium by
    <em>Brachyspira</em> species (classically <em>B. aalborgi</em> and <em>B. pilosicoli</em>).
    Patients may be asymptomatic or present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms such as
    diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and occasionally rectal bleeding. It is described more
    frequently in immunocompromised individuals, but it can also occur in immunocompetent patients.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    The key diagnostic challenge is that colonoscopy often looks normal or shows only subtle,
    nonspecific mucosal changes. Diagnosis relies on biopsy: the organisms form a dense band on
    the epithelial surface, creating the classic basophilic “blue fringe” on H&E. Silver stains
    (e.g., Warthin–Starry) or immunostaining for spirochetes highlight the organisms and confirm
    the diagnosis.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Treatment is most commonly metronidazole, with macrolides as alternatives. Symptomatic response
    can be excellent, but relapse has been reported—sometimes months after treatment—so clinical
    follow-up is important, and repeat evaluation may be needed if symptoms recur.

      Intestinal spirochetosis is often an incidental histologic diagnosis; symptoms, when present,
      can mimic IBS.

    <li>
      Colonoscopy may be grossly normal—biopsy is required, and pathologists must consider special stains.

      Metronidazole is commonly effective, but relapse can occur; symptom recurrence should prompt reassessment.
