    A 39-year-old man returned from a 9-month sabbatical traveling along the Amazon River
    in Colombia near the borders of Peru and Brazil. During his stay, he participated in
    indigenous ceremonies, sustained minor lacerations while cutting trees, and was scratched
    by monkeys. He reports multiple insect bites (mosquitoes and possibly sand flies), and a
    single episode of unprotected sexual activity. He also observed wildlife including pink
    dolphins, monkeys, and birds.

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Two months after returning, he presents with a slowly enlarging, firm, keloid-like lesion
    on his lower leg. There is no pain, systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, or mucosal
    involvement.

      id: "C",
      label: "Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis",
      feedback:

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Lobomycosis (also called Lobo’s disease or keloidal blastomycosis) is a chronic fungal
    infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue most commonly described in the Amazon
    regions of Colombia, Brazil, and Peru, and in dolphins. Infection typically follows
    traumatic inoculation, and lesions are characteristically slow-growing, firm, painless,
    and keloid-like.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    The causative organism is <em>Lacazia loboi</em> (a name proposed to replace older designations).
    The organism has not been isolated in culture, but sequencing data place it close to
    <em>Paracoccidioides</em>. Histopathology is the key diagnostic feature: thick-walled yeast-like
    cells that appear isolated or in chains connected by narrow bridges, producing the
    characteristic “Rosario beads” appearance on silver stains such as GMS.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Treatment is primarily wide surgical excision when feasible; relapse can occur and
    reinoculation has been described when instruments are contaminated. There is no reliably
    effective medical therapy, although itraconazole may have partial activity and is sometimes
    used as adjunctive therapy to reduce recurrence risk.

  Teaching points
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
    <li>
      Painless, keloid-like lesions after Amazon exposure and skin trauma should prompt
      consideration of lobomycosis.
    </li>
    <li>
      The “Rosario beads” pattern on GMS (chains of thick-walled yeast-like cells) is a key
      histopathologic clue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Lacazia loboi</em> has not been cultured; diagnosis is typically histopathologic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preferred management is surgical excision; medical therapy is inconsistently effective.
    </li>
