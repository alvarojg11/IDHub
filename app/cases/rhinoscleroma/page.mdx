    A 42-year-old man presents with several years of progressive nasal obstruction,
    nasal discharge, and intermittent epistaxis. Over the past 6 months, he has
    noticed worsening facial swelling and distortion of the nasal bridge, associated
    with a muffled voice and difficulty breathing through his nose. He denies fever,
    weight loss, night sweats, or cough.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    He was born and raised in rural Thailand and immigrated to the United States
    approximately 10 years ago. He reports living in crowded housing during childhood
    and early adulthood and has limited access to medical care. Most recently he has vacationed
    in South America (Peru and Brazil) about 6 months prior. He denies tobacco or
    illicit drug use. He denies any history of autoimmune disease or immunosuppression.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Physical examination reveals firm, nodular thickening of the nasal mucosa with
    partial obstruction of both nares. The nasal bridge appears broadened and
    indurated. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. Oral examination shows extension
    of nodular tissue into the nasopharynx. Lung and cardiac examinations are normal.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Computed tomography of the face demonstrates soft tissue masses involving the
    nasal cavity and nasopharynx with focal erosion of adjacent bone, without abscess
    formation. A biopsy of the nasal lesion is performed and shown below. Histopathology reveals
    granulomatous inflammation with numerous foamy macrophages containing intracellular
    Gram-negative bacilli (Mikulicz cells).

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the upper respiratory tract
    caused by <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> subspecies <em>rhinoscleromatis</em>. Unlike
    other members of the <em>Klebsiella</em> genus, this organism is restricted to
    human hosts and is transmitted through close contact, with disease occurring
    predominantly in impoverished regions of Central and South America, Africa, and
    Asia.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    The disease follows a progressive clinical course, often evolving from an
    atrophic phase to a granulomatous stage and eventually a fibrotic stage, leading
    to disfigurement and airway compromise. Because early symptoms are nonspecific,
    diagnosis is frequently delayed until advanced disease is present.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Histopathology is central to diagnosis and classically demonstrates granulomatous
    inflammation with foamy macrophages—known as Mikulicz cells—containing intracellular
    Gram-negative bacilli. Although the organism can be cultured on standard laboratory
    media, biopsy is often required for definitive diagnosis.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    The exact pathogenesis in which Klebsiella spp result in Mikulicz cell formation and 
    eventual rhinoscleroma is unclear. Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, like K pneumoniae, 
    is characterized by a mucopolysaccharide capsule that contributes to inhibition of phagocytosis, 
    thus facilitating intracellular survival. It has been postulated that cellular immunity is 
    impaired with a decreased CD4 to CD8 ratio but with humoral immunity remains intact.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Management requires prolonged antibiotic therapy, often for several months.
    Traditional regimens have included streptomycin or tetracycline, while more recent
    evidence supports the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or fluoroquinolones.
    Surgical débridement may be necessary in advanced cases, though relapse is common.
