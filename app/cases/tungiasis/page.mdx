    A 72-year-old woman from a remote Amerindian community in the Amazon lowland of
    Colombia is brought to medical attention because of progressive immobility and
    severe pain involving both feet. Over the past several months, she has become
    increasingly unable to stand or walk and now spends most of the day resting in
    a hammock.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    She lives in a small hut without a solid floor and has limited access to food
    and medical care. Several dogs live in close contact with her household. Because
    of chronic knee pain, she rarely leaves the dwelling and frequently places her
    feet directly on the dirt floor. Family members report that similar lesions have
    occurred intermittently for years but have worsened markedly over time.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Physical examination reveals hundreds of embedded nodular lesions involving the
    soles, lateral aspects of the feet, and interdigital spaces. Many lesions are
    closely packed and layered on top of one another, with surrounding hyperkeratosis
    and areas of necrosis. Similar clusters of lesions are noted at the ankles and
    knees. A strong malodor is present. The patient appears cachectic and dehydrated.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Laboratory evaluation shows severe anemia and mild leukocytosis. Examination of
    several lesions demonstrates viable ectoparasites embedded in the superficial
    layers of the skin.

  Rationale
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Tungiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by penetration of female sand
    fleas (<em>Tunga penetrans</em>, and less commonly <em>T. trimamillata</em>) into
    the superficial layers of the skin. Once embedded, the flea hypertrophies,
    enlarging dramatically over several days and inducing intense local inflammation,
    pain, and itching.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Although tungiasis is inherently self-limited—each flea eventually dies after
    releasing eggs—individuals living in endemic, resource-poor settings are
    repeatedly reinfected. Over time, parasite load accumulates, and disease severity
    correlates directly with the number of embedded fleas.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Very severe tungiasis occurs almost exclusively in individuals with pre-existing
    conditions that limit mobility, such as advanced age, disability, chronic joint
    disease, or neuropsychiatric disorders. Prolonged contact with dirt floors,
    intradomiciliary transmission, poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to health
    care form a web of causation that allows a normally benign infection to become
    life-threatening.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Complications include secondary bacterial infection, tetanus, severe anemia due
    to chronic blood loss, cachexia, and complete immobility. Effective treatment
    requires topical antiparasitic therapy (such as dimeticone formulations),
    supportive care, and addressing environmental sources of reinfection.

  Teaching points
</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
    <li>
      Tungiasis is usually self-limited, but repeated reinfection can lead to
      devastating disease in endemic settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Disease severity correlates directly with parasite burden.
    </li>
    <li>
      Elderly, disabled, or immobile individuals are at highest risk for very severe
      tungiasis.
    </li>
    <li>
      Poverty, intradomiciliary transmission, and limited health care access are
      critical determinants of morbidity and mortality.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dimeticone-based topical therapy is effective even in very severe disease.
    </li>
  </ul>
