  Headache, Ataxia, and Sixth Nerve Palsy in Connecticut

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    A 56-year-old woman living in rural Connecticut presents in early summer with 4 days of
    progressive bifrontal headache, nausea, and new gait instability. On the day of admission,
    she develops horizontal diplopia.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    She reports gardening and hiking frequently. One week prior to symptom onset, she removed a
    small tick from her posterior thigh after noticing it “briefly attached” following an evening
    walk. She estimates the tick was attached for less than 6 hours. She discarded the tick.
    She has no rash. She has not traveled outside New England. Past history is notable only for
    well-controlled hypertension.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    On examination she is afebrile and alert. Neurologic exam reveals truncal ataxia and a left
    abducens (VI) nerve palsy. Strength is full in all extremities.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    MRI brain with and without contrast shows patchy T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the thalami
    and dorsal brainstem without a focal abscess. Lumbar puncture reveals 160 WBC/mm³ with a
    lymphocytic predominance (80%), protein 85 mg/dL, and glucose 60 mg/dL (serum glucose 95 mg/dL).
    CSF Gram stain and bacterial culture are negative.

    CSF meningitis/encephalitis PCR panel is negative (including HSV-1/2, VZV, enterovirus,
    HHV-6). Serum and CSF testing for Lyme disease is sent. Given the geography and neuroinvasive
    presentation further testing is also pursued.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Rationale</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus that can cause severe neuroinvasive disease
    in the Northeastern and Upper Midwestern United States. In Lyme-endemic regions, most modern
    cases are thought to be caused by the deer tick virus lineage transmitted by <em>Ixodes scapularis</em>.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Clinically, patients often present with headache, fever, altered mental status, focal
    neurologic deficits, or cerebellar findings (e.g., ataxia). CSF typically shows lymphocytic
    pleocytosis with elevated protein. MRI may demonstrate involvement of deep gray structures
    (including thalami) and brainstem.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    A key teaching point is the distinction from other <em>Ixodes</em>-transmitted infections:
    experimental and clinical data suggest POWV can be transmitted rapidly—within hours and
    potentially minutes—after tick attachment. This contrasts with Lyme disease and babesiosis,
    which generally require more prolonged feeding.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-6 text-gray-800 mb-6 text-justify">
    Diagnosis is typically made by serology (POWV IgM) with confirmatory neutralization testing
    (e.g., PRNT). Treatment is supportive; there is no proven antiviral therapy. Because
    long-term neurologic sequelae are common among survivors, early recognition matters for
    prognosis, counseling, and public health awareness.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Teaching Points</h2>

<div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg leading-7 text-gray-800 space-y-2">
    <li>
      In New England, Powassan virus should be considered in encephalitis with cerebellar signs or
      focal deficits, especially with deep gray/brainstem MRI involvement.
    </li>
    <li>
      CSF often shows lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein; routine bacterial cultures and
      standard viral PCR panels may be negative.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike Lyme disease, Powassan virus may be transmitted rapidly after tick attachment—early
      tick removal helps but does not eliminate risk.
    </li>
    <li>
      Diagnosis is typically made by CSF POWV IgM with confirmatory neutralization testing (e.g., PRNT).
      Treatment is supportive; neurologic sequelae are common in survivors.
